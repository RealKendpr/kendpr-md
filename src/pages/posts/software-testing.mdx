## There are two types of testing; Manual and Automated.

### Manual Testing

This type of testing is what beginners, and probably most people do in small projects, and sometimes not even realizing it. Straight to the point, you test/try small functions inside your program/`yourFile.tsx` and see if it works as you want it to. So, it is done by a human, **you**, manually.

You interact with your application, you click buttons, submit form, go to this page that page, search for something, and see if they are working and functioning as you expected.

When doing a manual testing I think it's best that you make a list of what you are going to test, like what companies and corporations does in order to keep track of things..

And there are types of manual testing such as Unit Testing, System Testing, Integration Testing, Acceptance Testing etc.

### Automatic Testing

Well, from the name itself "Automatic", it means automatic and you don't have to do the testing on your own, but you have to of course setup the automation part; you will write code and/or use software that does it for you. There are various technologies that does or can help with the automatic testing; Jest, Cypress, etc.

According to this [dev.to article](https://dev.to/maddevs/manual-testing-vs-testing-automation-32c0), this type of testing are ideal "If there is a **large number of repetitive tests** to be run".

That's it for now because that's all I know about testing.
