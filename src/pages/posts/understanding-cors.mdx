# Understanding Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for an API

I recently made my first API, and when making an API, you need to configure CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, when you deploy it online. Basically, you need to specify which website or domain can make a request to the API, for example "https://example.com".

But when you are developing locally on your own computer, you don't necessarily need to specify which website can access it since you just make your request using "http://localhost:&lt;port-number&gt;", but sooner or later you're still going to want to host your API online, so you're going to need to setup CORS.

## Setting Up CORS in Node.js with Express

1. Install cors middleware using `npm install cors`
2. Inside the index.js:

```js
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "https://memarandom.onrender.com", //specify the allowed origin
  }),
);
```

Origin is where you specify what domains can make a request to the API; it can also take multiple origins.

**Allowing Multiple Origins**

To allow multiple origins, you have to make an array of origins as a string:

```js
origin: ["https://memarandom.onrender.com", "https://your-website.com"],
```

**Open Access for public APIs**

If you are making an API that is open for the public or that you want any websites to make a `GET` request, you can use an asterisk "\*,"Â  called a wildcard, to allow all websites:

```js
origin: "*",
```

**Caution**
You need to be very careful when using it, as it can lead to a potential security risk because you know it's an "aste--RISK".

Anyway, the API I just made is memarandom; it generates random memes from the memes that I have personally seen and laughed at. &lt;br/&gt;
