It features a soft and cool blues, minty greens, and soft purples.\n\n![Showing houston theme used inside visual studio code](../../assets/thumbnails/houston-preview.jpg)\n\nOne day I was just browsing for some VS Code theme and I came across this one, and looking from its preview it made me want to install it immediately and I really liked it, but it doesn't have a light mode. But Houston theme is still in progress accoriding to its [github repository](https://github.com/withastro/houston-vscode), so it might have a light mode in the future.\n\nAlso, it came with an _image-emoji_ face that they call 'Astro's mascot Houston' which looks cute.\n\n[Install Houston Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.houston)\n\n## Ayu Theme\n\n> `ayu` is a simple theme with bright colors and comes in three versions — dark, mirage and light for all day long comfortable work.\n\nI discovered this just after I installed the Houston Theme, and this one I really like. It comes with three different versions.\n\n![Showing three different version of Ayu theme; Dark, Mirage, and Light](../../assets/thumbnails/ayu-versions.png)\n\nThe dark version, the mirage version, and a light version, you can also chose to have a borders(\"ui_separator\"). What I like the most is the dark and the mirage version, but not the light one; maybe because of its contrasts.\n\nThis theme is just pretty clean and not very distracting to the eye, and the contrast of texts in the dark and mirage version is really great.\n\n[Install Ayu Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu)\n\n## Abyss\n\nNow this one is built-in inside visual studio code. It is a dark blue theme, and most of its colors are also dark shade.\n\n![Showing abyss theme used inside visual studio code](../../assets//thumbnails/abyss-theme.PNG)\n\nThis is also the theme I was using before I used Houston and Ayu theme.\n\n## Quite Light\n\nQuite light is a light mode theme with a purple accent, and this is the best light theme that I have seen so far. I just found out about it while writing this post.\n\n![Showing Quite Light Theme usde inside visual studio code](../../assets/thumbnails/quite-light-preview.webp)\n\nJust like the Abyss theme, this one is also built-in inside visual studio code, so it doesn't have to be installed.","src/pages/posts/my-top-vscode-themes.mdx","6679888920d12b93","pages/posts/understanding-cors",{"id":35,"data":37,"body":43,"filePath":44,"digest":45,"deferredRender":18},{"title":38,"description":39,"pubDate":40,"image":41,"draft":20},"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)","I recently made my first API, and when making an API, you need to configure CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, when you deploy it online.","September 16, 2024 3:25 PM",{"internal":20,"src":42},"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1649144974269-2cfed23287e1","## Understanding Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for an API\n\nI recently made my first API, and when making an API, you need to configure CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, when you deploy it online. Basically, you need to specify which website or domain can make a request to the API, for example `https://example.com`.\n\nBut when you are developing locally on your own computer, you don't necessarily need to specify which website can access it since you just make your request using `http://localhost:port-number`, but sooner or later you're still going to want to host your API online, so you're going to need to setup CORS.\n\n## Setting Up CORS in Node.js with Express\n\n1. Install cors middleware using `npm install cors`\n2. Inside the index.js:\n\n```js\napp.use(\n  cors({\n    origin: \"https://memarandom.onrender.com\", //specify the allowed origin\n  }),\n);\n```\n\nOrigin is where you specify what domains can make a request to the API; it can also take multiple origins.\n\n**Allowing Multiple Origins**\n\nTo allow multiple origins, you have to make an array of origins as a string:\n\n```js\norigin: [\"https://memarandom.onrender.com\", \"https://your-website.com\"],\n```\n\n**Open Access for public APIs**\n\nIf you are making an API that is open for the public or that you want any websites to make a `GET` request, you can use an asterisk \"\\*,\"  called a wildcard, to allow all websites:\n\n```js\norigin: \"*\",\n```\n\n**Caution**\nYou need to be very careful when using it, as it can lead to a potential security risk because you know it's an \"aste&mdash;RISK\".\n\nAnyway, the API I just made is memarandom; it generates random memes from the memes that I have personally seen and laughed at. &lt;br/&gt;\nIf you have any corrections to this blog, please contact me or open an issue in the [git repository](https://github.com/RealKendpr/kendpr-md/issues).","src/pages/posts/understanding-cors.mdx","b0e21fc00b1fa4a2"]
